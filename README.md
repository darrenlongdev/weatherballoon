Win64/32 Starlink Connected Weather Balloon

Some few years back I got to work on a weather balloon project with the payload running a Windows OS.
Photographs are automatically captured and named with a timestamp and altitude.
A command can be sent from ground control that automatically zips all photos and makes them available for
download. Alternately they can be downloaded individually.

In terms of connection, 3/4g was considered, but Spacex Starlink is preferred as will always be above the payload
to provide constant connection.

The code is written in AutoIt and PHP. It may however be better ported to another language, perhaps on a rasbery pi.

I'm unlikely to continue with the project, so wanted to make the code public in case its of use to anyone else or
am happy to work on it further with others.
